# MininCode-SocialWebSite
Fullstack project, which we created on MININCODE hackaton, and which need for major improvments

I created a webcore with [Sweepyd1](https://github.com/Sweepyd1)

It was my first experience at Vue.js, i was creating all functional part, and Sweepyd1, created a main page

We screw up a little because of little amount of time of developmed-only 7 hours

Backend was done by [dimflix](https://github.com/DIMFLIX-OFFICIAL)
